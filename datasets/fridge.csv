4,4,Samsung 253 L Double Door Refrigerator RT28A3022GS/IM,"Works longer for less

Digital Inverter Technology
Enjoy greater energy efficiency less noise and long-lasting performance. The Digital Inverter Compressor automatically adjusts its speed in response to cooling demand. So it’s quieter uses up to 50% less power* and is certified to work for 21 years** backed up by a 10-year warranty***.







* Based on internal testing comparing energy consumption (ISO 15502) between Samsung conventional model RT43K6**5(6)** and RT54E****** Awarded a 21-year durability certification by the Association for Electrical Electronic & Information Technologies in Germany (Verband Deutscher Elektrotechniker – VDE). The actual lifespan may vary depending on the usage circumstances.*** 10-year warranty is limited to the compressor only.





Evenly cools all over

All-around Cooling
Make sure that all your food is properly cooled – wherever it is. All-around Cooling system cools each compartment evenly from corner to corner. It continually checks the temperature and circulates cool air through strategically placed vents. So every item of food stays fresher for longer.










Voltage protection

Stabilizer Free Operation
Protect the refrigerator from power fluctuations*. The Stabilizer Free Operation keeps it working steadily and reliably. If the voltage increases too much it automatically cuts the power to prevent electrical damage. The compressor even operates at 50°C. So you don’t need a separate stabilizer.







* Stabilizer Free Operation range: 100 ~ 300V.





Easily reach food

Easy Slide Shelf
Organize put in and take out food more easilyso there’s no ‘dead space’. The Easy Slide Shelf is built on rolling hinges and simply slides in and out. It means you can quickly find what you want and easily reach things at the back and in every corner without items getting squashed or broken.










All the ice you need

Movable Ice Maker
Make sure that you always have plenty of ice to stay cool when it’s warm. A simple twist of the Movable Ice Maker is all it takes to dispense a large quantity of ice. But when the seasons change and there’s not much need for ice you can easily remove it and create more space in the freezer.










Optimal humidity

The stunning arched crown of the new range is just one example of its outstanding design aesthetics. While the inside of the refrigerator is designed to make your life more convenient the outside will also make it much more stylish and glamorous.





STABILISER FREE OPERATION
Samsung’s Refrigerators work very steadily and reliably even if there is high fluctuation in the voltage from as low as 160 V to as high as 260 V. The powerful compressor can even operate at 50 °C eliminating the need for a separate stabiliser and ensuring better energy efficiency. * stabiliser free operation range: 160 ~ 260 V.





16.5 L BIG VEG BOX
A quick glance is all it takes to find the right food thanks to a transparent bigger vegetable box. It’s also spacious enough to store large items such as watermelon and keep lots of other fruits and vegetable in the same place so it’s much easier to find everything you want.





TOUGHENED GLASS SHELVES
It’s safety first with the toughened glass shelves which can bear an impressive 150 kg of weight. They’re also free from heavy metals like lead and cadmium so there’s no risk of your food being contaminated.





ANTI FUNGAL GASKET
Keep your food extra hygienic with an anti-fungal door gasket that prevents fungi and bacteria from getting in and building up inside your refrigerator.





BIG BOTTLE GUARD
Why struggle to find space for larger bottles? You can easily store all of your favourite beverages (up to 2 L) using the spacious Big Bottle Guard in the new range of Samsung refrigerators.





SMOOTH BACK
A smooth safety panel covers the entire back of the refrigerator which protects the condenser so that it lasts longer and also makes it easy to keep the back clean.
