MANUFACTURERS DESCRIPTIONPower and minimalism with Lenovo LegionLegion 5 15 offers tons of options for every player. Its minimalist casing houses a powerful AMD Ryzen processor and NVIDIA GeForce graphics  and Legion Coldfront 2.0 watches over their appropriate temperature. The stunning refresh rate on the FHD screen with 100% color fidelity and the fast control of the TrueStrike keyboard will leave rivals far behind.
Playing with GeForce RTX ™. RTX is a serious game.Extremely fast and quiet operation. Real-time ray tracing and graphics enhanced by artificial intelligence. And on top of that the mobility of the slimmest and lightest structures in the world. Its all thanks to the NVIDIA Turing ™ GPU architecture and the breakthrough RTX platform. Now you can show what you can do - only on a GeForce RTX gaming laptop.
A cold front is approachingLegion 5 15 takes the bold steps where others dare to combine industry-leading thermal efficiency with any configuration you choose. The perfectly tuned Coldfront 2.0 cooling system dissipates heat through a dual-channel thermal mechanism with 67 liquid crystal polymer-coated fan blades with copper tubing. This will leave your rivals far behind with Q Control 3.0s manual selection of Quiet Sustainable and Competitive thermal modes. Turbocharging also offers the Dual Burn function which squeezes the maximum power from the CPU and GPU during the game.
Power and concentrationLegion 5 15 helps you stay in the arena wherever you are so it has a battery that lasts all day and an intelligent discharge power management system. It is powered by an elegant and small power supply with Rapid Charge Pro technology which replenishes the charge from 0 to 50% in less than half an hour. In hybrid mode the dedicated graphics card is disabled outside of games and Q Control 3.0 allows you to use Quiet Mode lowering the CPU voltage so you can concentrate longer on working without power from the outlet.
A sonic advantageThe Legion 5 15 emits loud deep bass sound through the Harman Kardon® 2W speaker system. Dolby Atmos® technology works with the headphones and produces an immersive three-dimensional sound that comes from all sides with surprising clarity and depth for complete immersion in any game environment. This way you gain an advantage in games because by locating individual sounds you can accurately track all threats - including those lurking above and behind you.",224999,no rating,no review, https://cdn.sastodeal.com/catalog/product/y/o/yoga_c740_1_1__1_1_.jpg,Laptop

Sastodeal: The One-stop Shopping Destination

About Us
Our story began in Dec 2011 when internet penetration in Nepal was just about 9%. Yet we were encouraged to start not just a company but an ecommerce industry that would have a significant impact in Nepal’s economy for generations to come. Bootstrapped with just Rs.50000 we rented a small garage worked on broken furniture and chairs and worked hard to build a strong company and significantly contributing in building an ecommerce industry. Today  Sastodeal  is one of the leading ecommerce companies in Nepal with millions of customers and thousands of vendors / partners all over Nepal. We have a logistic network that ensures deliveries in most parts of the nation with exceptions of some locations (work in progress). Our goal is to ensure that our users and customers can buy products at affordable prices get their products delivered as assured and on time regardless of their location. On the other hand we provide a platform for our vendors to cater to millions of customers without additional cost to their business.  

Sastodeal  Vision

Our vision is to make Nepal proud by being the best local example in customer experience.
